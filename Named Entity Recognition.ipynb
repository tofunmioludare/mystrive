    "Since today we are exploring the world of natural language processing, we’ll deepen in the Named Entity Recognition technique: this is just one of the mechanisms that NLP embodies. The recognition of named entities as the process of automatic identification of the entities present in a text and consequent classification into predefined categories such as \"person\", \"organization\", \"position\" is a quite common activity and expect for English, trained models with spaCy offer few labels that could be improved through training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the case study of this morning, try to emulate it in order to label all the brands present in the provided datasets, choosing the one you prefer OR trying to label all them and to train the model to recognize new different entities. The result should be twofold: the final model should be able to recognize brands that it has already seen, but already new ones.\n",
    "The brands proposed in the dataset concern fashion, cars and food.\n",
    "In order to test the accuracy of the model, test it with sentences and brands the model has never seen.\n",
